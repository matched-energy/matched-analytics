Mapper
====================


Map [Ofgem REGO Generating Stations](https://renewablesandchp.ofgem.gov.uk/) to [Elexon BM Units](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/api-documentation/endpoint/reference/bmunits/all).

Prerequisites
----------
- Parsed S0142 files (see [/elexon/S0142](../elexon/S0142))
- BMUs (see [/elexon/api](../elexon/api))
- Redeemed REGO certificates and accredited stations (see [/ofgem](../ofgem))

Mapping approach
----------
Mapping is done in two phases:

#### 1. Fuzzy meta-data match
A fuzzy match is made between:
- REGO station name, lead party name, and BM unit name
- fuel type
- generation capacity

The fuzzy match yields zero, one, or more likely matching BM units.

See `filter_on_bmu_meta_data.py`

#### 2. Validate against power & energy
Candidate BM units are appraised in terms of:
- their aggregate power rating, as compared to the nameplate capacity of the REGO station
- their monthly metered volumes, as compared to monthly REGOs 

See `filter_on_aggregate_data.py`

Mapping score
----------
A qualitative score summarises how well all the above are matched between REGO station and candidate BMUs.
The scores given are:
- `near certain`
- `very probable`
- `likely`
- `possible`

See `summarise_and_score.py`
